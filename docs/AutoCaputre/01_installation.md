# Installation

AutoCapture can be installed in two different ways, either **per project** level or **per engine version**. There's not much difference between the two install types beside the scope.

When installing for a project, only that one project will be able to use the plugin. While if the installation is done for the engine version, any project created in that engine version will have access to it.

## Per Project Installation

To install the plugin for a project, move the **AutoCapture** folder to the project **Plugins** folder.

## Per Engine Version Installation

To install the plugin for the engine version, find the engine installation, move the **AutoCapture** folder to the **Plugins** folder.
